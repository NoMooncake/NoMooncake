Exploring how data, machine learning, and design frameworks
can support human decision-making under uncertainty.
</p>

## Research Statement

I am interested in **how people make decisions in complex, information-dense environments**, and how **data-driven systems can be designed to reduce cognitive overload rather than amplify it**.

My work explores:
- how raw data can be structured into **decision frameworks**
- how machine learning models can remain **interpretable and trustworthy**
- how visualization and interaction design influence **sensemaking**

Rather than optimizing models in isolation, I focus on **human-centered data systems** that support clarity, comparison, and reflection.

## Research Interests

- Decision-making under uncertainty  
- Information overload & cognitive framing  
- Explainable and interpretable machine learning  
- Data-driven sensemaking tools  
- Human–AI interaction  
- Generative AI for analysis & storytelling

## Current Research Directions

- Designing **decision-support systems** rather than prediction-only models  
- Exploring **Generative AI** as a co-analyst and explanatory agent  
- Studying how different data representations influence user judgment  
- Bridging **machine learning + interaction design**

---

## Open Questions

- How much model accuracy should be sacrificed for interpretability?
- When does more information reduce decision quality?
- Can AI systems explain *why not* instead of only *why*?
- How can data systems support reflection instead of speed?
